UNET

It is a fully convolutional neural network model. which is developed to use in medical segmentation.
For an approach we used this model to separate the cloth from the image which we get from the YouTube dataset or from any other platform.
 Here Train_UNET is the trained model with some sample images inorder to predict and produces the output for a new image.

. Using semantic image segmentation, a convolutional neural network model is trained to detect the types of
clothes from images.
• We utilized discrimination because we want to distinguish between backgrounds, skin, and clothing.
Because backgrounds and skins are the most important sources of noise in this type of problem, we try to
eliminate them.
• We recreated the masks using the cuttings, by simply binarizing the image. The skin is obtained as a result
of the difference between people and their clothing.
• We trained a model that takes a raw image as input and produces a three-dimensional mask that can recreate
the desired separation between skin/background and dress from the original images. As a result, when a new
raw image comes, we can divide it into three parts: background, skin, and dress. We take into consideration
only the channel of our interest (dress). By using UNET segments the type of cloths.
• UNET uses convolution blocks followed by a maxpool down sampling to encode the input image into
feature representations at multiple levels.
